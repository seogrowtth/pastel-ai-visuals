        sections: [
          { type: 'h2', text: 'Phase 1: Image Selection and Preparation' },
          { type: 'p', text: 'Creating cinematic videos from still photos begins with selecting the right source material. The ideal image should have clear depth layers, interesting compositional elements, and sufficient resolution for high-quality output. Look for photos with distinct foreground, middle ground, and background elements that can be animated independently.' },
          { type: 'p', text: 'Technical specifications matter significantly: aim for images with at least 2048x2048 pixel resolution, minimal compression artifacts, and good contrast. Avoid images with motion blur, extreme darkness, or cluttered compositions that might confuse the AI\'s depth estimation algorithms.' },
          { type: 'h2', text: 'Step 1: Upload and Initial Analysis' },
          { type: 'p', text: 'Upload your selected image to your chosen AI platform (we recommend Pixwith.ai for this tutorial). Most advanced platforms will automatically analyze the image for depth information, identifying different layers and potential motion paths.

          { type: 'p', text: 'Push motions (zooming in) create intimacy and focus, perfect for revealing product details, emphasizing emotional moments, or building suspense. Pull motions (zooming out) provide context, create breathing room, or conclude narratives with satisfying resolution.' },
          { type: 'p', text: 'Best practices include starting and ending with static moments to provide visual anchoring, using smooth acceleration and deceleration curves, and ensuring the motion serves the content\'s emotional arc rather than being purely decorative.' },
          { type: 'h2', text: '4. Environmental Animation - Living Worlds' },
          { type: 'p', text: 'Environmental animation brings static scenes to life by animating natural elements like water, clouds, leaves, fire, or smoke. This style transforms ordinary photographs into living, breathing worlds that captivate viewers and extend engagement time significantly.' },
